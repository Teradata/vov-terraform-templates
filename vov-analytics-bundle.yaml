  ## Before you begin

  Please note: The developer analytics bundle VM will use 8 vCPUs, 32GB of memory and 40GB hard drive space


  ## Getting Started

  This image is intended as a companion VM to Teradata Vantage on VMware Developer Tier. It's recommended to install Teradata Vantage on VMware Developer Tier before installing this image.

  After installing the developer analytics bundle OVA in your environment:

  1) Begin by powering on the VM

  2) Once the VM has powered on, login as tdc (pass: teradata2022)

  3) Verify that the VM has obtained an IP address either via vCenter, or via the VM cli by issuing the command "ip a show ens160"

  4) If your environment does not have DHCP, then you will need to configure the instance with a static IP. (Reference the Ubuntu 20.04 documentation on how to set a static IP)
  
  5) Once the analytics OVA has an IP address, run the command "docker ps" to view the current running images

  6) Jupyter Lab is listening on port 8888 of the VM. Run the command "docker logs <Container ID" to get the Jupyter Lab token: Example "docker logs f7c30882aa43" will yield de80934786922234d48c3366fa42b98e1508f82a19da0030 as the token

  7) Open a browser tab to http://{VM IP}:8888?token=de80934786922234d48c3366fa42b98e1508f82a19da0030 access Jupyter Lab

  8) To access Apache Superset, open a browser tab to http://{VM IP}:8088/login/ and login as admin (pass: admin)

  9) To install Precog, you need will need to contact Precog [https://precog.com/](https://precog.com/) to obtain an access to their DockerHub repo. Once you have access, you can install Precog by running the installPrecog.py script in /home/tdc

  10)  To access Teradata Studio, you will need to install either VNC, XRDP, and/or Remmina on the VM. See: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/access-remote-desktop#1-overview

  11) Alternatively, you can visit [Teradata Downloads](https://downloads.teradata.com/) to download and install Teradata Studio on your laptop.
